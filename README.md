## ⚡ Why AegisGuard?

AegisGuard is not just another protection plugin. It is a complete **Land Economy Ecosystem** built from the ground up for performance. Whether you are running a classic Survival server or a massive multi-threaded Network, AegisGuard adapts.

### 🚀 Core Features

  * **Folia Native:** Built with robust reflection to detect **Folia** environments automatically. It utilizes the `GlobalRegionScheduler` for true multi-threaded safety without compromising features.
  * **Hybrid Storage:** Supports **MySQL/SQLite** (via HikariCP) for networks and flat-file **YAML** for simple setups.
  * **Async-First Design:** Heavy tasks like Dynmap rendering, Upkeep calculations, and Auto-saving happen off the main thread. Zero lag.

### 💰 The Land Economy

Turn land into a valuable asset.

  * **Upkeep System:** Owners must pay tax. If they fail, the plot expires.
  * **Auction House:** Expired plots don't just vanish—they go to auction\! Players can bid on abandoned bases.
  * **Global Marketplace:** Players can list their plots for sale or rent via a GUI.
  * **Expansion Requests:** Players can request radius increases via a menu. Admins approve/deny them with a single click.

### 🎨 Visuals & GUI

  * **The Ultimate GUI:** Manage Flags, Roles, and Settings via a clean, icon-based interface (`/ag menu`).
  * **Cosmetics:** Players can buy particle borders (Hearts, Flames, etc.) to show off their land.
  * **Dynmap Integration:** Real-time, asynchronous map rendering of all claims.
  * **Language Styles:** Players can switch between **"Modern English"** and **"Roleplay Style"** messages personally\!
