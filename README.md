⚡ What is AegisGuard?

AegisGuard is a modern, Folia-native land protection ecosystem for Paper, Folia, and Spigot servers.
It doesn’t just “protect chunks”—it transforms land into a living economy asset with taxes, auctions, roles, flags, and a rich player marketplace.

Players Can:

Claim land using a visual selection wand and full GUI control

Maintain their land through upkeep taxes

Buy, sell, or rent plots through the Global Marketplace

Watch inactive land enter a server-wide Auction House automatically

Admins Can:

Create Server Zones (spawn, warzones, jails, markets)

Manage land through intuitive GUIs

Integrate with Dynmap, BlueMap, Pl3xMap, Vault, PlaceholderAPI

Control flags, roles, world rules, and plot behavior easily

🎯 Key Features
⚡ Folia-Native Architecture

Auto-detects Folia / Paper / Spigot

Uses GlobalRegionScheduler for true async safety

Map sync, upkeep, auctions, and heavy tasks run off the main thread

💰 Living Land Economy

AegisGuard features a full real-estate economy loop:

Upkeep System – Plots require periodic taxes

Auction House – Expired plots go to public auction

Global Marketplace – Sell or rent plots through clean GUIs

🏰 Empire Building (Player Features)

Claims & Sub-Claims (Zoning) – Divide plots into rentable rooms/shops

Biome Cosmetics – Change the biome feel of your land

Particle Borders & Holograms – Stylish plot visibility

Guardian Codex (/ag menu) – Your all-in-one player command center

🛡️ Server Plot Architecture (Admin Tools)
