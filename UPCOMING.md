🔮 The Oracle: Roadmap to AegisGuard 2.0
"The Aegis has secured the present, but the future calls for expansion. We gaze now toward the horizon, where realms unite and cities rise."

This document outlines the planned features for AegisGuard 2.0. Our focus is shifting from single-plot management to Network Ecosystems and Social Economy.

🌐 Flagship Feature: The "Empire" Sync
Status: [High Priority] • Target: v2.0.0

We are breaking the walls between servers. If you run a BungeeCord or Velocity network, AegisGuard will become a singular, unified system.

💬 Global Plot Chat (The "Private Frequency")
No longer shall plot coordination spam the global chat.

The Feature: A dedicated, cross-server chat channel restricted to the members of a specific plot.

How it works:

Players toggle it with /ag chat or /ag c.

Messages sent here are only seen by trusted members of that plot, even if they are on different servers in the network.

Why: Keeps global chat clean for admins and allows factions/groups to coordinate raids, builds, and economy secretly.

🔗 Unified Limits
Global Claim Blocks: A player's claim limit tracks across the entire network. Claiming a plot on Survival uses up slots that reflect on Creative, preventing economy exploits.

🏙️ The Township System
Status: [Planned] • Target: v2.1.0

Transform from a simple plot owner into a Landlord.

Sub-Zoning: Use the Golden Hoe to define smaller areas inside your main plot (e.g., "Shop A", "Apartment 4B").

Rent Automation: List these sub-zones on the Marketplace. Other players can rent just that room from you.

Tax Collection: The plugin automatically collects rent from tenants and deposits it into the landlord's Vault account.

💎 The Nexus: Plot Progression
Status: [Concept] • Target: v2.2.0

Land should not be static; it should grow in power.

The Core: Every plot gains a "Nexus" block.

Leveling Up: Owners can invest XP and Money into the Nexus to level up the plot.

Unlockable Perks:

Lvl 5: Flight within plot borders.

Lvl 10: permanent Haste/Speed II beacon effects (no beacon required).

Lvl 20: Increased member slots and radius expansion limits.

⚔️ The Siege Module (Optional)
Status: [Concept] • Target: v2.3.0

For servers that desire conflict amidst the order.

Siege Banners: An expensive item that can be placed on an enemy border.

The Mechanic: Once placed, a timer begins. If the defenders fail to destroy the banner within 15 minutes, the plot's PVP and Container protections drop for 1 hour.

Balance: Completely optional config toggle. Perfect for Factions-Lite or Semi-Anarchy servers.

🔮 Augmented Reality (Visuals)
Status: [Planned] • Target: v2.0.0

Moving away from chat spam and towards modern UI.

Holographic Info: Entering a plot displays a floating Title/Subtitle or Hologram (via DecentHolograms) showing the Owner and Plot Name.

For Sale Signs: Plots listed on the marketplace will automatically project a floating hologram above their center, showing the Price and Seller.
